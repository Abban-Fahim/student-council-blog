          Our vision aims to take initiatives and bring notice to imminent
          events and activities taking place at our school, also keeping
          students informed on major activities that the student council
          instigates, publishing articles in awareness of pivotal topics
          surrounding the welfare of students and a place for students to evince
          their skills and talents.
